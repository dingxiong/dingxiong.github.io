## Why linkers?

I became interested in linker by reading Ian Lance Taylor's
[blog series](https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/38). He was writing a new
linker `gold` for binutils-gdb. There are lots of things I do not understand
from his blogs, so I tried to find a book that systematically talks about
linkers. That is "Linkers and Loaders" by John R. Levine. But some parts of the
book is outdated and he spent large paragraphs discussing object file formats
that I am not interested in at all. Later on, I found Ulrich's paper
[How to write shared libraries](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf).

All the names mentioned above are big figures in the history of C/C++ tool
chain. Sometimes I wonder how much time and effort I need before reaching
similar levels as them!

## Linkers and loaders

Recently, I am reading book "Linkers and Loaders" by John R. Levine. Chapter 4
talks about different sections in ELF object format. It says in C++
initializers and finalizers are put into `.init` and `.fini` sections
respectively. However, this is outdated. Checkout this
[post](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-11-07-init-ctors-init-array) instead.

In chapter 6 - "Libraries", John criticised the search order design of linker
when loading libraries. As claimed by John, loading by groups instead of
tweaking command line arguments order is much better. Actually, `--start-group`
and `--end-group` are already supported in `ld` linker.

## strong and weak symbols

Weak external symbols are treated as normal global symbols if some input file
happens to define them, or zero otherwise.

There a few good blogs talking about it:

- https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130108-00/?p=5623
- https://leondong1993.github.io/2017/04/strong-weak-symbol/)

## Relocation

Cite from "Linkers and loaders":

> We use relocation to refer both to the process of adjusting program addresses
> to account for non-zero segment origins, and the process of resolving
> references to external symbols, since the two are frequently handled
> together.

## Position independent code (PIC)

When loader loads the executable from disk, it cannot guarantee to put the
binary at a fix memory address. This means that the loader need to relocate all
data references inside the binary. If the memory chunk starts at 5000. It will
need to add this number to data addresses in this binary. The associated
problem is efficiency. If two programs loads the same library into different
memory locations, then how to share the same binary.

The solution in ELF position independent code.

You can learn more about loaders and PIC in chapter 8 of "Linkers and Loaders".

## .sa and stub files

## `ld` options

All options can be found [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld). Here, I
document some of them to enhance my understanding.

`-e symbol_name`: Specifies the entry point of a main executable. In Linux, the
default entry name is `_start`. In MacOS, it is `start`.

`--start-group` and `--end-group`: The specified archives are searched
repeatedly until no new undefined references are created. This is used to
resolve circular dependency. See this
[stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5651895/3183330).

`--start-lib` and `--end-lib`: You can pass a `.a` archive file to linker. But
this is not convenient in some cases. For example, if you have a bunch of
object files and you want linker to treat them as a archive file as whole, then
you need to archive them first and delete the archive after linking. You can
see more details from Fangrui Song's
[post](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-01-16-archives-and-start-lib).

`--whole-archive`: Not all object files inside an archive file will be linked
to the final executable. Only the ones that are actually used will be linked!
This will cause global variable initialization error sometimes.

`--hash-style`: possible values are `sysv`, `gnu` and `both`. Read more about
the difference from below articles:

- https://flapenguin.me/elf-dt-hash
- https://flapenguin.me/elf-dt-gnu-hash

## `ld.so`

`ld.so` is the dynamic linker.

`LD_LOAD_NOW`: resolve all symbols at program startup instead of deferring to
the first time being used.

`LD_DEBUG`: print out debug information about the dynamic linker.

## `readelf` usage

`-p --string-dump=<number|name>`: Dump the contents of section <number|name> as
strings. Ex: get the dynamic linker for binary

```
# readelf -p .interp /bin/ls

String dump of section '.interp':
  [     0]  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

### Build

#### MacOS

Checkout the
[binutils-gdb](https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/tree/master). In the root
folder, run

```
./configure --prefix=/Users/xiongding/tmp/ --enable-gold=yes --disable-nls --with-gmp=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gmp/6.2.1_1/ --with-mpfr=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/mpfr/4.2.0-p4
```

The make

```
brew install texinfo
make -j
```

The above steps do not work. Probably because the message during config.

```
*** This configuration is not supported in the following subdirectories:
     gdbserver ld gas gdb gprof sim
    (Any other directories should still work fine.)
```

#### Ubuntu

```
apt-get install -y build-essential libmpc-dev texinfo flex bison
./configure --enable-gold
make -j
```

The build process failed initially as some tool is missing. After installing
these tools, it failed again due to some error message related to bison input
file. I guess an interrupted build may created some bad bison file, so I rm the
whole folder and checkout it again. Then build succeeded.

### Code deep dive

Initial tasks: read symbols -> add symbols -> layout output sections.

Middle tasks:

Final tasks: write output to file.
