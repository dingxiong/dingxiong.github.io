## Bash

- Bash test framework: https://github.com/sstephenson/bats

## Zsh

### Parameter expansion

Zsh does not do word splitting. For example, this is what happens in zsh

```zsh
$ export DYDB="aws dynamodb --endpoint-url http://localhost:8081"
$ $DYDB list-tables
zsh: no such file or directory: aws dynamodb --endpoint-url http://localhost:8081
```

There are two ways to make it compatible with `bash`:

1. Use `${=variable}`
2. `setopt shwordsplit`

See [zsh FAQ](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/FAQ/zshfaq03.html).

### ZLE

[ZLE](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html) is the line
editor in Zsh. `readline` is the line editor in bash. so `.inputrc` in bash
cannot be used in zsh. We need to use `bindkey` builtin to define these key
bindings.
