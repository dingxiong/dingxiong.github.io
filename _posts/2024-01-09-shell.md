This doc contains my accumulated knowledge about console, terminal and shell.
I, together with many of you, do not spend dedicated time to learning these
concepts, but instead keep accumulating the knowledge from time to time.

# VT100

VT100 is a popular video terminal. I learnt a lot about it when I was following
[this guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) to build an
terminal editor from scratch. Some basic knowledge about VT100 helps you
understand your `.bashrc` and `.inputrc`.

Its [official doc](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html) is the place
you can find all you need to know. For example,
[Control Sequences](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#S3.3.3)
section shows that `ESC[` is the control sequence introducer.
[Cursor Control](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#T3-6) section
shows that `ESC[A` is the code for `Arrow UP`.

## SGR

[SGR - Select Graphic Rendition](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#SGR),
as name suggests, controls graphic rendition. The control sequence has format
`ESC [ Ps ; . . . ; Ps m`. VT100 doc does not provide all available selective
parameters. We can go to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
to find more.

The most useful case is to set color. From the table in the wiki link above,
`31` represents foreground color `red`. `41` represents background color `red`,
so `ESC[31,41m` means sets both foreground and background to `red`. Yeah, sure.
Nobody will set the foreground color the same as background color :). Also, it
says `0` resets the color. So `ESC[m` or `ESC[0m` resets the color.

## Bash

## Zsh

### Parameter expansion

Zsh does not do word splitting. For example, this is what happens in zsh

```zsh
$ export DYDB="aws dynamodb --endpoint-url http://localhost:8081"
$ $DYDB list-tables
zsh: no such file or directory: aws dynamodb --endpoint-url http://localhost:8081
```

There are two ways to make it compatible with `bash`:

1. Use `${=variable}`
2. `setopt shwordsplit`

See [zsh FAQ](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/FAQ/zshfaq03.html).

### ZLE

[ZLE](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html) is the line
editor in Zsh. `readline` is the line editor in bash. so `.inputrc` in bash
cannot be used in zsh. We need to use `bindkey` builtin to define these key
bindings.
