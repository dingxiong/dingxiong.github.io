## Relay vs Apollo client

Both are clients of graphql in React.

## Useful tools

- chrome plugin: GraphQL Network Inspector

## Apollo client URI

Recently, I took a look at the Apollo client links documentation. The `uri`
parameter caught my eyes. It says

```
uri: The URL of the GraphQL endpoint to send requests to. Can also be a function that accepts an Operation object and returns the string URL to use for that operation.
The default value is /graphql.
```

I was like how a relative path `/graphql` tells the address of the graphql
server. Then I realized that if the query happens on
`http://www.example:9000/a/b/c`, then a uri `/graphql` means
`http://www.example:900/graphq`. Underneath, Apollo client uses `fetch` to call
this endpoint. The key distinction is between `URI` and `URL`. For example,
(your address, your name) uniquely identified yourself. This is `RUL`. (Your
name) is `URN`, i.e., uniform resource name. While, `URI` is a super set of URN
and URL. It can either be a relative name or path + name. That is why you can
either pass `/graphql` or `http://www.example:9000/graphql` to the Apollo
client `HttpLink` constructor.

## graphql-code-generator

GraphQL Code Generator is a CLI tool that can generate Typescript types out of
a GraphQL schema and operations (query/ mutation/ subscription, and fragment).
Graphql code generator needs a schema file to generate strong typed queries.
This schema file can be obtained by directly querying the `/graphql` endpoint.
The call sequence is

```
graphql-codegen-cli/bin.ts -> generate-and-save.ts:generate ->
  -> codegen.ts:executeCodeGen -> config.ts:loadSchema
```

Then it jumps to another pacakge `graphql-config`, which has a few overloaded
`loadSchema` function. Each corresponds to a different loader. See
https://www.graphql-config.com/docs/library/loaders for more details about how
`/graphq` endpoint is used to get the schema. It contains the graphql DSL
parser code, which is quite interesting.

Graphql code generator has many plugins. One is `Typescript-operations`. It
will find all graphql code segments in the files specified in `documents` and
generate the corresponding typescript. The files not need to be `.graphql` it
can be `.ts` or `tsx`, as long as it has graphql code segments.

## graphql-core

This weekend (2022/10/16) I spent some time reading
[graphql core code](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-legacy) in
python and got a deeper understanding about how graphql works. Basically, it is
a DSL with a parser and an executor.

The executor part is interesting. Basically, it is a recursive call that
traverses the ast. See
[`resolve_function`](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-legacy/blob/v2.3.2/graphql/execution/executor.py#L317-L365)
and the
[default resolver](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-legacy/blob/6e2fbccdec655ce9122b84d3808c14242c4e6b96/graphql/execution/utils.py#L351).
From the implementation, I finally understand what the first two parameters
`(root, info)` in graphql resolver mean.

Another interesting part is retrospection. Graphql uses a visit pattern to
traverses the abstract syntax tree. Checkout the `validation` folder for
examples.

Customization is doable too. then `execute_graphql` function allows you to
provide a custom root. Also, `schema` allows you to provide user defined types.
