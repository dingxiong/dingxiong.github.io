## Background

Deep diving into TLS is an item in my TODO list for a long time. But as you
know, procrastination is not easy to overcome. The opportunity finally comes: I
need to set up mTLS for a webhook endpoint for Zip. No way to bypass it now!

TLS seems intimidating for a beginner because there are multiple protocols
involved.

- On the network side, TLS is built on top of TCP. So you need know a little
  bit about TCP. At least we should know that the first 3 packets at the
  beginning of a https request `SYN`, `SYN & ACK` and `SYN` belong to TCP, and
  then come with TLS handshake packets. Because we are dealing with binary
  packets, we need to know a bit about the binary protocol of TLS message
  schemas.
- On the cryptography side, TLS uses asymmetric keys to verify server's
  identity or even client's identity if we use mTLS. This part requires some
  background in cryptography, such as how RSA works, how certificate is
  generated, and etc. This part involves binary protocols you probably never
  heard of. Cryptography is a difficult subject. The logistic is quite subtle
  such that the first time you think you understand it, the second time you may
  start to question some steps.

Anyway, complexity can only be transferred but does not disappear. There is no
shortcut to understanding TLS. The good news is that Golang has a very concise
cryptography related libraries `crypto/tls`. If you are willing to make your
hands dirty and spend enough time reading the detailed implementation, you will
master TLS. Let's go then!

## What did people say?

If I can find a good blog online that can resolve all my confusions about TLS,
then I won't write this article by myself. Learning from others is always the
step before getting hands dirty by ourselves. The best article about TLS I
found online is from
[Moserware](http://www.moserware.com/2009/06/first-few-milliseconds-of-https.html).
In his blog, he showed all details about the handshake process of TLS using
Wireshark. Needless to say that he is an expert on this topic!

However, I could not follow his blog step by step because the TLS version he
demonstrated is TLS 1.0, and I am using TLS 1.3. A lot of things changes from
1.0 to 1.3. For example, in his blog Moserware showed that the server sent its
certificate to client after the `ServerHello` packet. He could read the
certificate clearly in Wireshark, but I failed. I only received an encrypted
sequence of bytes. I cannot even tell where the certificate starts in the
response binary. OK. Not surprisingly, someone had similar doubt and posted his
[doubt online](https://ask.wireshark.org/question/14909/tls-13-certificate/).

> "All handshake messages after the ServerHello are now encrypted. The newly
> introduced EncryptedExtensions message allows various extensions previously
> sent in the clear in the ServerHello to also enjoy confidentiality
> protection"

Hmm. Things changed from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3. I felt a little discouraged to
finish Moserware's post. So that is why I decided to write this post.

# TLS and cryptography

Cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third
parties or the public from reading private messages.

## TLS version history

- 1999 TLS 1.0
- 2006 TLS 1.1
- 2008 TLS 1.2 [RFC-5246](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246)
- 2018 TLS 1.3 [RFC-8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446)

Hmm. It seems TLS 1.4 will arrive in a few years. The key note I extracted out
after reading TLS 1.3 specs is

> TLS consists of two primary components: A handshake protocol and A record
> protocol

The handshake protocol is the core part of TLS and will be discussed in detail
later. Here, we briefly go through the record protocol. Simply put, Record
protocol is a collection of schema definitions used in handshake and the
(de)serialization protocols used for these schemas. Chapter 3 "Presentation
Language" provides details about how TLS data is serialized to bytes on the
wire. Primitive types are simple. Meanwhile, composite types like vectors use a
`length + data` serialization approach. See the description in
[section 3.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-3.4). When
checking the Wireshark result, Wireshark shows the size followed by the
content.

I have seen quit a few binary protocols so far, including protobuf, Thrift,
kafka, TCP etc. They all serve the same purpose: build a binary contract for
communication between two parties. The details are boring and there are lots of
mature tools on the market that does (de)serialization for you, so you do not
need to burn your brain to decode the byte sequence by yourself. But I find it
is a tiring to learn such protocols from time to time.

There are only 4 different records in TLS:
`handshake, application_data, alert, and change_cipher_spec`. I copied the
schema definitions below.

```
enum {
  invalid(0),
  change_cipher_spec(20),
  alert(21),
  handshake(22),
  application_data(23),
  (255)
} ContentType;

struct {
  ContentType type;
  ProtocolVersion legacy_record_version;
  uint16 length;
  opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
} TLSPlaintext;
```

Wireshark does a good job in deserializing the bytes to these structures for
you.

# Some tools

## Wireshark

**Installation**

I went to the official website https://www.wireshark.org/ and downloaded the
version for my laptop MacOS Arm. Then open the download folder and double click
the image and drag it to application folder.

**Usage**

Open Wireshark using sudo
`sudo /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/Wireshark`. Set the filter and
hit the `Start Capture` button.

![wireshark_filter](/assets/images/wireshark_filter.png)

Meanwhile, make a https request.

```
$ curl -v -X POST 'https://webhook-staging.ziphq.com/api/infra/2' --header 'x-api-key: xxx' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"payload": {"a": 1}}'
*   Trying [2606:4700:3108::ac42:2bc0]:443...

...
```

I forced curl to use IPv4 `-4` or `--ipv4` because I am not familiar with ipv6
header structure. Also, the output shows the steps in a TLS handshake.

Then Wireshark showed the TCP packets. Regular TCP and TLS packets interleaved.
The first 3 packets are TCP 3-way Handshake. Then after that, client and server
negotiated the cryptography algorithms and client verified server's
certificate.

![wireshark_capture](/assets/images/wireshark_capture.png)

Let's take a closer look at the packets. A network packet has format as below

```
|<-- Ethernet header -->|<--                   Ethernet body                -->|
                        |<-- Ip header -->|<--          Ip packet body      -->|
                                          |<--  TCP header -->|<-- TCP body -->|
```

It is layers of layers of protocols. Each protocol layer is split into a header
part and a body part. Specifically for the above message,
[Ethernet header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame) is

```
48 bd ce 16 81 7c -> MAC destination
bc d0 74 3d 77 a2 -> MAC Source
08 00 -> Ethertype
```

I think there are some Preamble bytes before MAC destination bytes according to
the protocol, but not sure why Wireshark does not display it.

The [IPv4 header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4)
starts with `45 00`. Here `4` means it is IPv4. If you see `6` then it is IPv6.
`5` means the header has 5 32-bit blocks. Namely, IPv4 header has 20 bytes. The
rest is the IP addresses, port numbers, etc.

Check out
[TCP header format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
by yourself.

## tcpdump

If we do not have access to wireshark, then tcpdump is another option. Both
wireshark and tcpdump are built on top of libpcap.

Below we only capture the handshake packets, and only the client hello message
is shown.

```

$ sudo tcpdump -X "tcp port 443 and host webhook-staging.ziphq.com and (tcp[((tcp[12] & 0xf0) >> 2)] = 0x16)"

15:48:39.460847 IP 10.0.0.202.59334 > 172.66.43.192.https: Flags [P.], seq 3035635353:3035635870, ack 501278632, win 2060, options [nop,nop,TS val 370768872 ecr 1493848618], length 517

How to read tcpdump bytes output? Each row has 16 bytes arranged in 8 words.
The left most column is the index of starting byte of this row. For example,
the last row index `0x0230` means the first byte of last row has index
`2*16^2 + 3*16 = 560`.

Note the packet starts with `4500`, which is the starting bytes of an IPv4
header. This is different from Wireshark's result. Tcpdump does not show
Ethernet header.

Let's decompose the bytes into sections

```
        0x0000:  [4500 0239 0000 4000 4006 55f3 0a00 00ca
        0x0010:  ac42 2bc0]
        0x0010:             [e7c6 01bb b4f0 1e99 1de0 e7a8
        0x0020:  8018 080c 1dd0 0000 0101 080a 1619 7be8
        0x0030:  590a 522a]
        0x0030:             [1603 0102 0001 0001 fc03 0321
```

TCP header starts at `e7c6`. Meaning of each field in TCP header:

- `e7c6 = 59334`: source port number
- `01bb = 443`: destination port number
- `b4f0 1e99 = 3035635353`: sequence number
- `1de0 e78a = 501278602`: Acknowledgment number
- `8018`:
  - `8`: represents data offset in 32bits. So data offset is at 32 bytes.
  - `0`: reserved, must be 0.
  - `18`: flags.

TCP data starts at `1603`. Probably need to remember `0x01bb = 443`.

# Handshake

## Client Hello

client hello https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-4.1.2

```
      uint16 ProtocolVersion;
      opaque Random[32];

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303;    /* TLS v1.2 */
          Random random;
          opaque legacy_session_id<0..32>;
          CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
          opaque legacy_compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
          Extension extensions<8..2^16-1>;
      } ClientHello;


```

Random field no longer has the UTC time.

## Server Hello

ServerHello message chooses the CipherSuite and replies to client. Meanwhile,
server needs to present its certificate to client. As a newbie, I have no idea
how a server obtains his certificate, so let's deviate to the topic of
certificate creation for a while.

A certificate is created in 3 steps.

### Step 1: create a private key

```
$ openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

$ cat server.key
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        ...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Github reminds me of the security issue of displaying secret key as plain text,
so I omit it. Though I do not care about this test key.

The file format of `server.key` is
PEM([Private Enhanced Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail)).
Sometimes people use suffix `.pem` instead of `.key`. Basically, given a byte
sequence, we first transform it by base64, and then add a header and footer, we
get a PEM file. The header is not like a free form string. It is more like an
enum field. There are only a few headers used in cryptography. Besides
`RSA PRIVATE KEY`, we will see `CERTIFICATE` and `CERTIFICATE REQUEST` later in
this post.

What are the bytes before base64 transformation? That is another encoding
called DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). It is used to serialize
schemas/types defined in ASN.1 language. ASN.1 is similar to protobuf. We write
schemas in `.proto` files then serialize them to bytes using the serialization
library provided by protobuf. Here, schema is defined in ASN.1 and serialized
using DER encoding. In this case, the schema is
[RSAPrivateKey](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2313#section-7.2).

```
RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
 version Version,
 modulus INTEGER, -- n
 publicExponent INTEGER, -- e
 privateExponent INTEGER, -- d
 prime1 INTEGER, -- p
 prime2 INTEGER, -- q
 exponent1 INTEGER, -- d mod (p-1)
 exponent2 INTEGER, -- d mod (q-1)
 coefficient INTEGER -- (inverse of q) mod p
}
```

[A Warm Welcome to ASN.1 and DER](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/a-warm-welcome-to-asn1-and-der/)
is a good blog post about this topic. Also, you can paste the base64 encoded
string above to https://lapo.it/asn1js/ to check the original data structures.
For the `server.key` above, the decoded `RSAPrivateKey` is
![private_key_decoded](/assets/images/private_key_decoded.png)

_A randome rant_: Golang's DER implementation is
[here](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/cryptobyte/asn1.go#L754).
This is why I love golang. Everything I need is already inside std, and is
super concise. I can quickly learn the implementation details of the topics
that I am interested in. If not golang, I probably need to dive into openssl
and spend hours navigating around, reading huge functions, and getting lost in
the details of openssl's own implementations of string and array.

Ok. Come to the meaty part! What does these numbers `n, e, d, p, q` mean? Now
it is the perfect time to introduce RSA encryption.

#### A crush course on RSA

[CS265 SJSU](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/CS265/SecurityEngineering/chapter5_SE/RSAmath.html#:~:text=The%20Mathematics%20behind%20RSA&text=In%20RSA%2C%20we%20have%20two,the%20private%20key%20is%20d.&text=C%20%3D%20Me%20mod%20N.)
is a crush course of RSA. The basic idea is a pair of formula

```
Let M = a message,
Let C = a ciphertext.

encrypt: C = M^e mod N
decrypt: M = C^d mode N
```

We use exponent `e` and modulus `N` to encrypt a message, and then we can only
decode a ciphertext if we know the inverse exponent `d`. It is hard to get `d`
from `e` using a brute-force method given `N` is very big number. But if `N=pq`
and we know `p` and `q` then it is fairly easy. So in this sense, we should
keep our `p, q, d` private. That that is why the above file is called private
file. On the other hand, `e`, `N` should be disclosed to clients, and they are
called public keys.

Let's take a look at golang's RSA implementation.

The encryption code is
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/rsa/rsa.go#L422).
The decryption code is
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/rsa/rsa.go#L543).
The main line is
[m = new(big.Int).Exp(c, priv.D, priv.N)](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/rsa/rsa.go#L589).
They are exactly the formula above. Encryption uses public key. Decryption uses
private key. Actually, there are another function in RSA called `sign`, that is
signing a message to get the signature of this message. `sign` uses private key
as well, and we will talk about it later.

### Step 2: Generate certificate signing request (CSR)

After we have the private key, we need to ask CA to sign it.

```
$ openssl req -new -nodes -key server.key -out server.csr -subj /C=CN/ST=GuangDong/L=Guangzhou/O="Localhost Server"/CN=not-important

$ cat server.csr
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```

The definition of CSR is in
[RFC2986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2986#page-7). For easy of
ready, I copy it below

```
CertificationRequest ::= SEQUENCE {
     certificationRequestInfo CertificationRequestInfo,
     signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier{{ SignatureAlgorithms }},
     signature          BIT STRING
}

CertificationRequestInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
    version       INTEGER { v1(0) } (v1,...),
    subject       Name,
    subjectPKInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo{{ PKInfoAlgorithms }},
    attributes    [0] Attributes{{ CRIAttributes }}
}

AlgorithmIdentifier {ALGORITHM:IOSet } ::= SEQUENCE {
    algorithm          ALGORITHM.&id({IOSet}),
    parameters         ALGORITHM.&Type({IOSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
}
```

Using https://lapo.it/asn1js/ to decode it, we get below result:

![certificate_signing_request](/assets/images/certificate_signing_request.png)

Field `certificationRequestInfo` contains business related info. Just to call
out a few important fields:

- public key: the modulus `2544936...` and exponent `65537`.
- signatureAlgorithm: `sha256WithRSAEncryption`.
- commonName: `not-important`. This field is very important. it must be the
  host name that the generated certificate is used with.
- signature: bit string `01010101...`. This signature is used to assure CA that
  the request indeed owns the private key corresponding to the public key in
  the folder.

Golang's CSR struct definition is
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b2a56b7053e72a7888c4f054289ea053b0e1ab36/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L1775)
and this
[function](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L1875)
build a CSR. Let's dive into the details of how the signature `01010101...` is
created in CSR.

#### CSR signature

Signature inside CSR is create by line
[signature, err = key.Sign(rand, signed, hashFunc)](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L2017).
Here `key` in our case is a RSA key, and the implementation of `Sign` function
is
[here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go.1.19.2/src/crypto/rsa/rsa.go#L145).

```
func (priv *PrivateKey) Sign(rand io.Reader, digest []byte, opts crypto.SignerOpts) ([]byte, error) {
	if pssOpts, ok := opts.(*PSSOptions); ok {
		return SignPSS(rand, priv, pssOpts.Hash, digest, pssOpts)
	}

	return SignPKCS1v15(rand, priv, opts.HashFunc(), digest)
}
```

The normal case is the `SignPKCS1v15`. Basically, this function signs a message
in two steps:

**Step 1: prepare the buffer**

The byte buffer structure is shown blow.

```
buffer:         | 0x00 | 0x01 | 0xff ... | 0x00 | prefix | hashed msg |
byte index:          1     2      3 ...
total lenght:   |<----          lenght of private key             --->|
```

There are a bunch of paddings and an algorithm specific prefix. The last part
of this buffer is the hashed message. This buffer has the same length as the
private key. Moserware in his
[blog](http://www.moserware.com/2009/06/first-few-milliseconds-of-https.html)
spent extra time talking about this padded buffer and shown the bytes in
Wireshark.

**Step 2: decrypt**

This part decrypts the above buffer and obtains the signature of this message.
As we know, decryption uses private key, so as long as you have the
corresponding public key, we can verify that this signature and be sure that
the guy who generated this signature must know the private key.

This process is contrary to what I thought before diving into this topic. For a
long time, I thought signature must be produced by some encryption process. But
it turns out it is the opposite. Signature is generated by decryption and it is
kind of a voice to the whole world:

> Hey guys, this is my signature. Please come to verify it using the public key
> I distributed on internet. You will believe that I am the true owner of the
> private key. Even though I will never share the private key with you :)

**Signature verification**

Signature verification process is the reverse of signing a message. See this
[function](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L2096).
It eventually calls function
[VerifyPKCS1v15](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/rsa/pkcs1v15.go#L319)
which is the reverse of `SignPKCS1v15` above. The signature of a CSR will be
verified when CA uses this CSR to generate a certificate. But I did not find
the verification step in golang's crypto library :(. However, this
[stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42663584/3183330) uses this
verification step before generating a certificate.

BTW, as a newbie in cryptography, for a long time, I thought signature and
certificate are the same thing :(. Now, I understand that signature is just a
long number. While certificate is usually a file containing a lot of
information such as business address, issuer, root CA, validate time range,
signature and etc.

### Step 3: Sign it

This step should be done by CA. In our case, the CA root is also generated by
us.

```
$ openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.pem

$ cat my_client.pem

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Sorry, I lost my `server.pem`, so use `my_client.pem` as example. We can also
check the content of certificate using

```
$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'my_client.pem'
```

Certifiate format is defined in
[rfc5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1), and is copied
below:

```
   Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
        signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
        signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

   TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
        serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber,
        signature            AlgorithmIdentifier,
        issuer               Name,
        validity             Validity,
        subject              Name,
        subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
        issuerUniqueID  [1]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
                             -- If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
        subjectUniqueID [2]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
                             -- If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
        extensions      [3]  EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
                             -- If present, version MUST be v3
        }
```

A few notes about the fields in a Certificate:

- `tbsCertificate` stands for "to be signed certificate". Most fields are
  copied from the CSR file.
- `subject` contains the business information of this server, such as address,
  business name, (CN) common name, and etc. CN is probably the most important
  field because client will verify CN is the same as the host name it is
  connecting to. See more details
  [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ea565f156b6c789cab058437f902950bd98e1b7f/src/crypto/x509/verify.go#L1084).
  By the way, there is also a field called
  [Subject Alternative Name](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ea565f156b6c789cab058437f902950bd98e1b7f/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L756)
  which serves as a supplement to CN. On the other hand, in mTLS, both server
  and client should present their certificates. Only server's CN is verified,
  not client's CN. So we can write anything to the CN field in a client
  certificate.
- `issuer` is the organization that signs this certificate. `issue` has the
  same type as `subject` field. It contains `issuer`'s business information. In
  most cases, `issuer` is just one of the well known certificate authorities
  (CA).
- `subjectPublicKeyInfo` is the public key of this certificate holder. It is
  not the public key of the issuer.
- `signatureValue` is the signature signed by the issuer's private key.
- You may notice that `AlgorithmIdentifier` field shows up twice. They should
  be the same. Checkout golang the certificate parser code
  [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/a3ced4a6333dc669359e77004fa3f8a662961cb5/src/crypto/x509/parser.go#L800).

In golang, the certificate is created by
[CreateCertificate function](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L1478).
The above certificate is as blow inside https://lapo.it/asn1js/ .  
![certificate_decoded](/assets/images/certificate_decoded.png)

A side note: we can use openssl to view the certificate of a server

```
$ echo | openssl s_client -servername www.example.com -connect www.example.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -text
```

## Certificate validation

After the client receives the certificate from server side, it validates it.
Most time the certificate message from the server contains only one
certificate. The client only needs to verify that this certificate is really
signed by a well known CA. Basically, the client side has a pre-installed
collection of CAs, and it tries to match each CA's common name with the
certificate's issuer. It there is a match, the client uses this CA's public key
to verify the signature inside this certificate. If signature matches, then the
client knows that this certificate is valid.

Sometimes, the certificates presented by the server may form a chain, say
`c1 -> c2 -> c3`. `c1` is the leaf certificate, and is signed by `c2`. `c2` is
signed by `c3`. When the clients receives these 3 certificates, it needs to
verify this sign chain is valid and also `s3` is signed by a well known CA.

Golang's implementation is super easy to follow. I would recommend reading some
key functions such as
[buildChains](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.19.2/src/crypto/x509/verify.go#L893)
to have a better understanding about what I said.

## To be continued...

# Different implementations

Wikipedia list the different
[implementations of TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations).
I want to know the common usages in different programming languages. In C/C++,
probably everyone will turn to openssl. In Java, JSSE is the standard
implementation that is bundled together with every Java version. In Golang, TLS
is supported in std.

## Golang

A good example is
https://gist.github.com/xjdrew/97be3811966c8300b724deabc10e38e2 .

## Java

TODO: need to figure out keystore, truststore.
