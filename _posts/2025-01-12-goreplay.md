Golang 1.7 has a DNS [problem](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16739) of
resolving hosts like `**.local`. This is important in kubernetes. So a fix is
raised and
[released](https://go-review.googlesource.com/q/project:go+branch:release-branch.go1.7+status:merged)
in Golang 1.7.1.

When testing goreplay, you should not port forward the source pod. For example,

```
--input-raw k8s://pod/fastapi-strawberry-example-64cdf67bf-nlcxj:8123
```

if you do
`k forward-port fastapi-strawberry-example-64cdf67bf-nlcxj 8123:8123`, then
goreplay will not receive traffic from this pod.
