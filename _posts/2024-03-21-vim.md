Missing features:

- Cannot explore 3rd library file structure. In vscode, you can view them
  directly.

Smooth scrolling is very important.

## Build

```
cd neovim
make
ln -s build/compile_commands.json compile_commands.json
```

We need this build step to see those generated files.

## Concepts

LSP (Language server protocol) is the key to configure Vim. In VScode, LSP is
used for clangd to work correctly.

# Lua

What level of Lua knowledge is required to efficiently work with Neovim? I
believe you only need to read https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html .

# stdlib

Neovim has a lua stdlib. Basically, it is a bunch of C functions or submodules
that are exported to a Lua module `vim`. Because this module is auto loaded, we
do not need to explicitly import it. Therefore, we can write `vim.print(...)`
in our Lua code directly.

How this binding is done? It is done by the standard Lua function
`lua_pushcfunction` or `luaL_register`. The relevant code is
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/7e97c773e3ba78fcddbb2a0b9b0d572c8210c83e/src/nvim/lua/executor.c#L719).
You can see that `print` is set as a global function, and many other functions
are added. A few lines blow it calls `nlua_state_add_stdlib()` which loaded a
few more functions and submodules. We can use below script to print out all
stdlib.

```lua
for key, value in pairs(vim) do
    if type(value) == 'function' then
        print(key)
    end
end
```

## vim.api

Neovim also defines a bunch of api functions under a sub module `api` under
`vim` module. See
[code](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/7e97c773e3ba78fcddbb2a0b9b0d572c8210c83e/src/nvim/lua/executor.c#L743).
The corresponding file `lua_api_c_bindings.generated.c` is auto generated. I
copy part of its content as below

```c
void nlua_add_api_functions(lua_State *lstate)
  FUNC_ATTR_NONNULL_ALL
{
  lua_createtable(lstate, 0, 175);

  lua_pushcfunction(lstate, &nlua_api_nvim_get_autocmds);
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "nvim_get_autocmds");
  lua_pushcfunction(lstate, &nlua_api_nvim_create_autocmd);
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "nvim_create_autocmd");
  lua_pushcfunction(lstate, &nlua_api_nvim_del_autocmd);
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "nvim_del_autocmd");
  lua_pushcfunction(lstate, &nlua_api_nvim_clear_autocmds);
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "nvim_clear_autocmds");
  ...
  lua_pushcfunction(lstate, &nlua_api_nvim_win_text_height);
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "nvim_win_text_height");
  lua_setfield(lstate, -2, "api");
}
```

# Event loop

# Tips

### how to use :lua command

```
:lua =jit.version
```

### how to use Neovim as a Lua playground

Open a new file and write some lua code, and then

```
:luafile %
```

TODO: I still could not figure out how to easily redirect the output to
somewhere else.

### pretty print

- `vim.inspect`

### % not working

Usually because you have unmatched braces in the comments or in a string like
regex. In this case, you can use treesitter's incremental selection.

### treesitter is not working with vim -S session.vim

I once have this problem. The issue is the with markdown files. Manually do
`TSUpdate markdown` fixed this issue.

### how to format json

Format the whole file `:%!jq .`. Format a selection: After selection, then type
`:`, then it will show up `:'<,'>`. Type `:'<,'>!jq .`. If you do not want to
overwrite the current buffer, `:'<,'>w !jq .`.
