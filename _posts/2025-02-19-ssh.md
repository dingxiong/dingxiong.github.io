I use SSH almost every work day, but never thought about how it works exactly
until one day I got an error message `Permission denied (publickey)` when
trying to git clone a repo. This post documents what I learned about SSH.

There are two versions of SSH: 1.0 and 2.0. Almost all cloud vendors only
support SSH 2.0 these days. You can check the remote server ssh version as
follows,

```
$ ssh -v user@server
...
debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version 71aa2b1d4
```

(TODO: write the difference between SSH1.0 and SSH2.0).

The SSH protocol is mainly covered by
[rfc-4252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4252) and
[rfc-4253](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4253). There are multiple
authentication methods: `publickey`, `password` and `hostbased`. Usually,
`hostbased` is disabled in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, and `password` is seldomly
used in any serious workflow, so we only talk about `publickey` authentication.
I will use golang's implementation to illustrate the SSH connection process.

## Connection Steps

We need some preparation steps. First, on the client side, use `ssh-keygen` to
generate a private key and public key: `id_rsa` and `rd_rsa.pub`. Then we add
the public key to server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

The connection steps are as follows:

1. Establish a
   [TCP connection](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/client.go#L80).
2. [SSH Version Exchange](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/client.go#L100).
3. Negotiate algorithms. It seems that golang does not implements this step.
   But you can consult rfc-4253 section 7. Or just run `ssh -vT git@github.com`
   and the output shows a few `SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT` messages.
4. Client sends a service request, and server sends a service response. See
   [code](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/client_auth.go#L26).
5. Client sends a request which contains its public key, and the signature of
   the message. The signature is
   [signed by the private key](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/client_auth.go#L356).
   After server receives this request, it first verifies that the provided
   public key is one of those inside `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. See
   [code](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/server.go#L659).
   Here `PublicKeyCallback` is initialized from file `authorized_keys`. See
   this
   [example](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/example_test.go#L60).
   Then the server
   [verifies the signature](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/server.go#L725)
   using this public key. If verification is successful, then it means the
   client indeed holds the private key.

Try `ssh -vT git@gitub.com` to see the whole authentication chain logs.

## Binary Protocol

Where are those message number defined in golang? See
[code](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/911360c8a4f464342b9fe7c23632be57fca87b20/ssh/messages.go#L153).
