vector is a combination of `filebeat` and `logstash`.

## VRL syntax

See blog https://vector.dev/guides/level-up/transformation/

> The . acts as a sort of “container” for the event data. . by itself refers to

> .foo.bar[0], and so on to reference subfields, array indices, and more.

Also I found the `log()` function is every useful for debugging.
