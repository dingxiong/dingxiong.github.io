## RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

RMI is a way of calling methods on remote objects over a network connection. It
is similar to RPC, but the biggest difference is that RPC deals with data
structures such as primitives, lists, maps etc in its stubs; while RMI deals
with Java objects. Thus, RMI requires both client and server to be written in
Java. That is why RMI is a terribly constrained protocol.

Because RMI needs (un)marshals Java objects on the wire, it relies on Java
Object Serialization. See this
[doc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/specs/rmi/protocol.html#:~:text=The%20RMI%20protocol%20makes%20use,return%20data%20when%20circumstances%20warrant.)
for more details about this binary protocol.

Why need I study RMI? Because JMX is built on top of RMI and many popular
frameworks export metrics through JMX such as kafka.
