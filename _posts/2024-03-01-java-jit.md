You may heard about Graal in Java community, but do not know how exactly it
works. OK. I do not know either, and this post is about my learning about Java
JIT compilers.

For a long time, Java has two JIT compilers: c1 and c2, which stand for client
JIT compiler and server JIT compiler. Both were written in C++. There are many
problems with this approach. For example, C++ segment fault will crashes the
Java virtual machine. Then [JEP 243](https://openjdk.org/jeps/243) proposed
that we should write JIT compilers in Java. That is JVMCI, i.e., JVM compiler
interface. Graal complies with this interface.

The JVMCI interface is defined
[here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/2edf9c3f1e968779c6e92b3e25d780db68ace5cc/src/jdk.internal.vm.ci/share/classes/jdk/vm/ci/runtime/JVMCICompiler.java#L28).
