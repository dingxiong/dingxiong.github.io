## Problem statement

Our company uses `sqlalchemy + aiomysql`, and sometimes we see blow error. Not
sure what happens

aiomysql version is 0.2.0.

## Mysql protocol

The
[official doc](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/page_protocol_connection_phase.html)
describes the mysql client connection process. Before we try it out using
wireshark, we mention a few gotchas. First, Mysql client uses Unix socket
instead of TCP on localhost

> On Unix, MySQL programs treat the host name localhost specially, in a way
> that is likely different from what you expect compared to other network-based
> programs: the client connects using a Unix socket file.

Therefore, wireshark cannot capture any traffic. To bypass this, we need to
explicitly set the host to 127.0.0.1. Second, we should turn off TLS,
otherwise, after the handshake, we cannot decipher anything from wireshark's
output.

So we run mysql client as blow.

```
mysql -u<...> -p<...> -h 127.0.0.1 --ssl-mode=DISABLED
```

The traffic captured is below:

First thing to note is packet number or
[sequence_id](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/page_protocol_basic_packets.html).
For each new request, no matter whether it is from server or client, it has a
starting sequence_id zero. Then this number increases until the request cycle
ends. In the above screenshot, the first 5 packets belong to one request cycle,
and the sequence_id is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

The first packet `Server greeting` corresponds to function
[\_get_server_information](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql/blob/98ad0fe07e642e19a293f9db282541ced2201d8a/aiomysql/connection.py#L539)
![Mysql TCP packets 1](/assets/images/wireshark-mysql-packet-0.png)

The second packet `Login Request user=root` corresponds to function
[\_request_authentication](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql/blob/98ad0fe07e642e19a293f9db282541ced2201d8a/aiomysql/connection.py#L540)
![Mysql TCP packets 1](/assets/images/wireshark-mysql-packet-1.png)

So in normal case, after `Login Request`, the server should send the client
with a sequence_id 2, but the error message is
`Packet sequence number wrong - got 1 expected 2`. The server sent a message
with sequence_id 1, which means it is a response a message to request message
from the client side. But this is the connection process, there shouldn't be
any attempt to send a different message. How could this be possible? A few
hypotheses:

1. reconnect effect?
2. asyncio.gather?
