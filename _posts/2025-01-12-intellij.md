## JDK and Maven issue

When a maven project fails to build, you first need to check if the
`mvn package -DskipTests` can work directly in cmd line or not. If yes, then it
is most likely the JDK version or maven version issue.

Intellij ships with a bundled maven which may be too old. You can check its
version as below.
![intellij-mvn-version](/assets/images/intellij_mvn_version.png) You can choose
maven wrapper which is a repo specific maven script. `mvnw` is similar to
`gradlew`. You can set it up by
[mvn wrapper:wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/tools/wrapper/). The generated
property file is like below.

```
$ cat .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
wrapperVersion=3.3.2
distributionType=only-script
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.9.10/apache-maven-3.9.10-bin.zip
```

It also generates a shell script `mvnw` that basically does the following
thing.

1. Check if `$HOME/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-<version>-bin` exits or not.
2. If exists, then use it to run maven command.
3. If not, then download it first.

## Issues

- go to definition not working  
  Choose the right source root. The right source root can be found from the
  import pattern.
