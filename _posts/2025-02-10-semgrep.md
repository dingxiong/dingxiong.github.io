Semgrep is a cool project. Command line entry is
[here](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/blob/6a1a467f34fc15dea066aff20e9a9bc9a69a1442/cli/src/semgrep/cli.py#L62).

A few comment commands

```
# scan a doc to test patthen matching
semgrep scan -l yaml -e '<pattern_to_test>' <file_name>

# Sometimes, the pattern has new line or indendention that is not easy to put
# into one line, we can simply do
semgrep scan -l yaml -e "$(cat pattern.txt)" <file_name>

# run the rule directly
semgrep scan -l yaml --config <rule_file>
```

Semgrep has wildcard operators in generic pattern matching. See
[doc](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/generic-pattern-matching).
