# About

I came across a post about
[defer.h](https://github.com/Jomy10/defer/tree/master) on Discord today. And I
just fell love in it! I was always curious how to achieve `defer` in C. In C++,
we can use destructor. In Golang, it is provided out of box. Let's see what I
learnt from this tiny header file.

See an example program

```c
#define DEFER_IMPL
#include "defer.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int* create_my_int() { return malloc(sizeof(int)); }
void destroy_my_int(int* i) { free(i); }

int main(void) {
  int* i = create_my_int();
  defer({
    destroy_my_int(i);
  });
  printf("%d\n", i);
  // defer block is executed here, freeing i
}
```

Using gcc with `-E` option, the code after pre-processing is below.

```c
extern inline void do_defer(defer_block* ptr);

extern inline void do_defer(defer_block* ptr) {
 (*ptr)();
}

int* create_my_int() {
  return malloc(sizeof(int));
}

void destroy_my_int(int* i) {
  free(i);
}

int main(void) {
  int* i = create_my_int();
  defer_block __attribute__((unused)) __attribute((cleanup(do_defer))) __defer0 = (
    { void __fn__(void) { destroy_my_int(i); }; __fn__; }
  );
  printf("%d\n", i);

}
```

One side note about MacOS. MacOS provides gcc command if you installed xcode or
llvm. But this is not the GNU gcc. it is a wrapper on top of clang. To test GNU
gcc, you need to install it from brew. Also, the path to it is
`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/13.2.0/bin/gcc-13` on my Macbook.

First, `__attribute(cleanup(do_defer))` means variable `__defer0` has a
destructor called `do_defer`. It will be called when `__defer0` gets out of
scope. This is my first time to see `cleanup` attribute.

Second, note the type of `__defer0` is a function. And the function is defined
on the fly. I fell love into the closure tricks in C.

Third, where does name `__defer0` come from? It is `__defer##__COUNTER__`. Ah!
I learnt a new predefined macro in gcc.
