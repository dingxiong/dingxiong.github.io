The literature seems have different meaning for DDL. Some refers it as Data
Definition Language. Others may refer it data dictionary language.

## Online DDL

Online DDL refers to do db migration without shutting down read/write traffic.
This
[post](https://web.archive.org/web/20160323015907/https://blogs.oracle.com/mysqlinnodb/entry/online_alter_table_in_mysql)
provides a great summary. Basically, most online DDL requires two metadata
lock. One at the initialization stage. And the other at the final commit stage.

## metadata lock state

When a DDL query is in the metadata lock state then any query that we run, be
it DML or SELECT, will also be in metadata lock state.

TODO: read source code to verify it.

Questions:

- How select query hold a metadata lock?

## Foreign keys

foreign keys are used to model a parent -> child relationship. It is naturally
a one to many model: the child table has a column whose content is the parent's
primary key. Standard SQL requires this one-to-many relationship is strict,
meaning that the referencing columns in the parent table are primary key or
unique index. However, Mysql/Innodb is different. Its foreign key can model
many-to-many relationship. Innodb only requires the referencing columns in the
parent table are a prefix an index. See
