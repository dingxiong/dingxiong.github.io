## Thunk

The word `thunk` sounds so strange when I first read it in LLVM source code.
Then Chatgpt told me

This story is not mentioned in
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk), but the idea is similar. A
thunk is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into another subroutine.
Anyway, this word is popular in compiler world!

Why we need thunk in vtable?

- Virtual inheritance
- Adjusting the this Pointer in Multiple Inheritance
- Covariant return types
