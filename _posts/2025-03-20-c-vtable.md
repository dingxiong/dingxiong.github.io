[Nimrod's post](https://nimrod.blog/posts/what-does-cpp-object-layout-look-like/)
is the best blog I found online that explains virtual table. This post tries my
best to answer a few questions.

1. What is inside vtable?
2. How does dynamic dispatch work?
3. How does `dynamic_cast` works?

```cpp
struct A { int x; virtual A* get_instance(){return this;}  };
struct B { char y; };
struct C : public B, virtual public A { double z; virtual C* get_instance(){return this;} };

int main() {
  A a = C();
  return 0;
}
```

```
$ clang++ -Xclang -fdump-record-layouts -emit-llvm -c ~/tmp/test.cpp -std=c++17

*** Dumping AST Record Layout
         0 | struct B
         0 |   char y
           | [sizeof=1, dsize=1, align=1,
           |  nvsize=1, nvalign=1]

*** Dumping AST Record Layout

           |  nvsize=12, nvalign=8]

         0 |   (C vtable pointer)
         8 |   struct B (base)
         8 |     char y
        16 |   double z
        24 |   struct A (virtual base)
        24 |     (A vtable pointer)
        32 |     int x
           | [sizeof=40, dsize=36, align=8,

Original map
Vtable for 'C' (8 entries).
   0 | vbase_offset (24)
   1 | offset_to_top (0)
   2 | C RTTI
       -- (C, 0) vtable address --
   3 | C *C::get_instance()
   4 | vcall_offset (-24)
   5 | offset_to_top (-24)
   6 | C RTTI
       -- (A, 24) vtable address --
   7 | C *C::get_instance()
       [return adjustment: 0 non-virtual, -24 vbase offset offset] method: A *A::get_instance()
       [this adjustment: 0 non-virtual, -24 vcall offset offset] method: A *A::get_instance()

Virtual base offset offsets for 'C' (1 entry).
   A | -24

Thunks for 'C *C::get_instance()' (1 entry).
   0 | return adjustment: 0 non-virtual, -24 vbase offset offset
       this adjustment: 0 non-virtual, -24 vcall offset offset

VTable indices for 'C' (1 entries).
   0 | C *C::get_instance()

Original map
Vtable for 'A' (3 entries).
   0 | offset_to_top (0)
   1 | A RTTI
       -- (A, 0) vtable address --
   2 | A *A::get_instance()

VTable indices for 'A' (1 entries).
   0 | A *A::get_instance()
```

## Thunk

The word `thunk` sounds so strange when I first read it in LLVM source code.
Then Chatgpt told me

> The term "thunk" was first used in the 1960s in the BLISS programming

This story is not mentioned in
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk), but the idea is similar. A
thunk is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into another subroutine.
Anyway, this word is popular in compiler world!

Why we need thunk in vtable?

- Virtual inheritance
- Adjusting the this Pointer in Multiple Inheritance
- Covariant return types

```
struct A { virtual void  foo() { cout << "A" << endl; } };
struct B{ virtual void  foo() { cout << "B" << endl; } };
struct C : public B, public A { virtual void  foo() { cout << "C" << endl; } };
```

It compiles

```
std::cout << Method->getParent()->getName().str() << ":" << Method->getName().str()
  << "|" << Overridden->getParent()->getName().str() << ":"  << Overridden->getName().str() << std::endl;
```

output

```
C:foo|B:foo
C:foo|A:foo
```

It is a map from the derived method to the list of base/overridden methods.
