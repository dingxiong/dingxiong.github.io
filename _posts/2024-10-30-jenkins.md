## Jenkins pipeline

Jenkins pipeline is probably the most important concept that a newbie needs to
learn. Whenever you write a `Jenkinsfile`, you write a pipeline. When I started
to use and learn Jenkins, it is so hard for me to get the pipeline correct
because of syntax errors and so many methods/tokens provided by various
plugins. OK. So let me document what I have learnt so far.

First, Jenkins pipeline is not a core part of Jenkins. It is provided as a
collection of plugins.
[workflow-aggregator-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-aggregator-plugin/tree/master)
is the umbrella plugin for Jenkins pipeline. This repo does not have any code.
It just declares in the `pom` file the component repos that make up Jenkins
pipeline.

### Pipeline syntax

One of the plugins that make up pipeline is
[pipeline-model-definition](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin).
It implements the pipeline
[parser](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/077ad1928a4012780319d9cfc1a40fb0cb510290/pipeline-model-definition/src/main/groovy/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/modeldefinition/parser/ModelParser.groovy#L64-L64).
Pipeline blocks are parsed as Groovy AST nodes. Therefore, pipeline share the
same syntax as Groovy.

#### Step syntax

The `steps` clause defines a block of statements. Each statement defines a
[step](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/077ad1928a4012780319d9cfc1a40fb0cb510290/pipeline-model-definition/src/main/groovy/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/modeldefinition/parser/ModelParser.groovy#L994-L994).
Each step is parsed a method call. I said "method call", not anything else! In
Groovy, a method call can omit the parentheses, so for a shell step, both
`sh "xxx"` and `sh("xxx")` are correct syntax.

Each step has the format `function_name arg1, arg2, ...` or
`function_name, arg1, arg2, ..., argN, closure`. See
[code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/077ad1928a4012780319d9cfc1a40fb0cb510290/pipeline-model-definition/src/main/groovy/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/modeldefinition/parser/ModelParser.groovy#L1249-L1249).
Basically, the last element in the statement can be a closure, which defines
child steps. Using the second format, we can write slightly more complicated
steps like one below

```
steps {
    timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
        retry(5) {
            sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
        }
    }
}
```

A step also can be a
[script block](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/077ad1928a4012780319d9cfc1a40fb0cb510290/pipeline-model-definition/src/main/groovy/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/modeldefinition/parser/ModelParser.groovy#L1240-L1240).

#### Environment syntax

Environment values can be string constant or Groovy gstring. See
[code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/077ad1928a4012780319d9cfc1a40fb0cb510290/pipeline-model-definition/src/main/groovy/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/modeldefinition/parser/ModelParser.groovy#L613-L613).

Btw, I once tried to update environment variables inside a stage and got
blocked for about 5 hours. Basically, environment variables cannot be changed
once set inside `environment {}` block. There is a
[stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53541489/updating-environment-global-variable-in-jenkins-pipeline-from-the-stage-level)
about it, and this
[post](https://e.printstacktrace.blog/jenkins-pipeline-environment-variables-the-definitive-guide/)
is the ultimate guide on this topic.

### Pipeline execution.

[workflow-cps-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin) has a
good introduction about the design of execution engine of Jenkins pipeline.

#### Step exeuction

[invokeStep](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin/blob/a6ac2775ac1767f68ddabcff14364235a61e8bdf/plugin/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/cps/DSL.java#L246-L256)
shows the distinction of a step with and without a ending closure.

TODO: read more about jenkins execution engine. Try to understand the design
philosophy of a JVM based execution engine. This will be super useful in future
if I need to design a DSL in Java. Also, compare it with logstash. Logstash is
Ruby based and it can execute arbitrary Ruby code without DSL execution engine.

## Plugins

1. `jenkins/inbound-agent`. Quote from docker hub "This is an image for Jenkins
   agents using TCP or WebSockets to establish inbound connection to the
   Jenkins master." so each jenkins agent pod will have a `jnlp` container,
   which runs this image.
2. Kubernetes plugin: allow you to spin up new plugin agent pod to run jobs.
3. Pipeline: Nodes and Processes: shell command step.

## API

### Remote access

Ex:

```
export JC='curl --user admin:<TOKEN>'
$JC  'https://jenkins.tryevergreen.com//api/xml' | xq
```

## Gotchas

### java.io.NotSerializableException

You may see this error when you use `groovy.json.JsonSlurper` in your pipeline.
This is because Jenkins has a paradigm where all jobs can be interrupted,
paused, and resumable through server reboots. To achieve this the pipeline and
its data must be fully serializable. See this
[doc](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/93ae9896d0bcb1ccc577dbbd64203320df05a6d1/TUTORIAL.md#serializing-local-variables)
for the background and ways to fix it.

### Scripts not permitted to use method ...

For example

```
Scripts not permitted to use method java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime isBefore java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime.
```

Jenkins' Security Plugin requires whitelisting methods that can be used in
Groovy sandbox. The default whitelist is
[here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/script-security-plugin/blob/df2fc45f229c75a4ab8c88800bee49370462eb7b/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/scriptsecurity/sandbox/whitelists/generic-whitelist#L1).
Also, you can whitelist new methods: Manage Jenkins > In-process Script
Approval.
