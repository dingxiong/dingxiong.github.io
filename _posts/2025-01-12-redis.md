## Why Redis is fast

I love the comments under https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/160157573 :)

## Todo

- learn the flow of main function
- figure out how replication works such that it does not return stale data?
- figure out how atomicity is maintained. read after write works?
- figure out persistence works?

## What happens for BRPOP?

Recently, I am investigating celery issues that uses redis as the message
broker. It uses `BRPOP` underneath to consume messages. I then wonder if a
redis client calls `BRPOP` and then dies before it receives the response, what
will happen?

`BRPOP` is handled by
[this function](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/f8a5a4f70ccada85943af90f6f2db3250ee50b27/src/t_list.c#L1283),
It then comes to these lines of
[code](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/f8a5a4f70ccada85943af90f6f2db3250ee50b27/src/t_list.c#L1253-L1257),
copied below.

```
        addReplyArrayLen(c,2);
        addReplyBulk(c,key);
        addReplyBulk(c,value);
        decrRefCount(value);
        listElementsRemoved(c,key,where,o,1,1,NULL);
```

As you can see, it adds the reply to the write buffer, and then remove list
elements. The reply will be sent to client at next epoll cycle. See more
details from [this post](https://www.ditanshow.com/articles/p/312.html). Ok,
now we know how that the `BRPOP` actually pops the element before the reply is
sent to client, so it is possible that redis client crashes and the data is
gone too.
