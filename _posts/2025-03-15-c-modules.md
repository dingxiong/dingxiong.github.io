## Why do we have header files?

[p0132r0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0142r0.pdf)
is a great manuscript about the history and problems with using header files.
To sum up, C/C++ files has a notion called `independent compilation`, which
means each translation unit is processed independently. For a translation unit
to use a function in another translation unit, we should use keyword `extern`,
and it is the linker's duty to figure out the correct source that provides the
implementation. However, what if multiple translation units want to use the
same function? Each of them needs an exact same `extern` statement, which is
error-prone and hard to refactor. That is why header files come to rescue.

What problems does this header file approach have? One obvious issue is the
long build time. A bigger problem, in my opinion, is the interaction with ODR
(one definition rule).

## Current status

So far, neither clang nor gcc supports syntax `import std.vector` or
`import <vector>`. We should use `#include` inside global module.
