## TCP

### Keepalive

<https://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/>

## Socket in general

The first newbie question when doing socket programming is how to tell a socket
has received all bytes from the other party. If you do not handle it well, you
may get stuck forever at `recv`. The python
[Socket Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html)
summarizes this issue as the fundamental truth of sockets:

> messages must either be fixed length (yuck), or be delimited (shrug), or
> indicate how long they are (much better), or end by shutting down the
> connection

There are only 4 ways! Joash Xu illustrates the first three in his
[blog](https://enzircle.com/handling-message-boundaries-in-socket-programming).
For the last option, you can read Ivan Velichko's
[blog](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/writing-web-server-in-python-sockets/).
Also, I want to mention that HTTP protocol uses both delimited method and
length method. It uses `\r\n` to separate the title line and header lines. Then
it uses content-length header to determine the size of data section.

## Netlink socket

The best tutorial online is from
[Kevin He](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7356).

> Side note: Kevin He built a company call Deepmotion. It sounds interesting.

## Epoll

TOD: read this https://gist.github.com/dtoma/564375673b354397efc5 This is
almost the same implementation as Java's default
[http server implementation](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/dc08216f0ef55970c96df43bcc86ebd5792d486e/src/jdk.httpserver/share/classes/sun/net/httpserver/ServerImpl.java)
