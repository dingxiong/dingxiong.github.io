Logstash is a pipeline for data ingesting, filtering and transformation. It is
written using JRuby and Java. So It is quite a headache to navigate between
Ruby code and Java code. In Logstash, there are 3 main concepts: input, filter
and output. All of them are pluggable and configurable in its configuration
yaml file.

## Pipeline

How it works? Let's dive into the code. Here we use v8.5.1.

- The main function is
  [here](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/Logstash.java#L60-L60).
  It calls the `run` method and interesting things happen. It gets a ruby
  script `InputStream script = config.getScriptSource()` and then runs it.
  Where is this script? A few lines after, you see
  [ruby config comes from environment.rb](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/Logstash.java#L246-L246).
- `environment.rb` simply calls
  [LogStash::Runner.run](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/lib/bootstrap/environment.rb#L90-L90),
  and `runner.rb` starts
  [an agent](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/runner.rb#L409-L419).
- This agent acts like a controller. It mainly does two things. First, it
  starts a
  [web server](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/agent.rb#L115-L115)
  which provides stats endpoints for logstash. Second, it
  [create pipelines](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/agent.rb#L337-L343).
  Well, it first figures out the pipeline creation actions from the
  configuration file and then executes these actions, i.e., the "converge"
  process. Let's see how it constructs the pipeline actions. This part is
  delegated to a file `state_resolver.rb`. Following the call chain, you see it
  creates
  [JavaPipeline](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb#L29-L29)s.
  This is where Java and Ruby starts to interleave. The base class of
  `JavaPipeline`, i.e., `JavaBasePipeline` is defined in a
  [Java file](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/execution/JavaBasePipelineExt.java#L50-L50).
  Annotation `@JRubyClass(name = "JavaBasePipeline")` creates the mapping
  between Java world and Ruby world. A Ruby class subclasses a Java class!
  There are a lot of details that follow from this point. Read below
  subsections!

### Pipeline queue

In the initialization function of `JavaPipeline`, it calls a function
[open_queue](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb#L49-L49).
This is a method in the
[base class](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/execution/AbstractPipelineExt.java#L197-L226).
Notice that how `@JRubyMethod(name = "open_queue")` connects Java and Ruby
worlds. This function basically creates a queue and creates an input client
(write client) and a filter client (read client) for this queue. OK. At this
point, we have a taste of how logstash works internally.

Let's see what queue it creates and the capacity of this queue. The logic is
[here](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/ackedqueue/QueueFactoryExt.java#L52-L101).
Aha! it supports two modes: file mode and memory mode. File mode is marketed as
`persisted` mode. So basically, `memory` mode has potential of losing messages
during abrupt shutdown. Let's focus on the memory mode as it is the default
mode. It creates a `BlockingQueue<JrubyEventExtLibrary.RubyEvent> queue;` with
capacity `pipeline.batch.size * pipeline.workers`. Therefore, write client or
read client can get blocked if the other is slow. This data can be found from
the logstash stats api. I want to stop here. There are already a lot of details
talked, you can finish the rest or read
[this article](https://priesttomb.github.io/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF/2021/01/03/learn-dim-from-logstash-source-code/).

### Pipeline workers

Inside a `JavaPipeline`, you can have multiple workers that fetch messages from
the `BlockingQueue`. The main logic is
[here](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb#L242-L242).
It first set up output plugins, i.e., `maybe_setup_out_plugins`, and then get
the number of worker from config:
`pipeline_workers = safe_pipeline_worker_count`. Then it creates this many of
worker threads.

```
worker_loops = pipeline_workers.times
  .map { Thread.new { init_worker_loop } }
  .map(&:value)
```

## Plugins

You can use `bin/logstash-plugin list` to list the current installed plugins.
Logstash plugins are written in ruby.

Logstash 6.6.0 starts to support
[native Java plugins](https://www.elastic.co/blog/logstash-6-6-0-released).
Unfortunately, the Elasticsearch output plugin is still written in Ruby.

### Ruby filter plugin

[Ruby filter plugin](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-ruby)
is my favorite pipeline. It allows you writing inline ruby code in logstash
yaml configuration file. The core part is
[this line](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-ruby/blob/main/lib/logstash/filters/ruby.rb#L63),
which calls your Ruby script for each `event`. Also, see the Apis of `event`
[here](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d909f33bae93a26b5e5895c3429bb87c5f47f83e/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/ext/JrubyEventExtLibrary.java#L54-L54).

## Metrics

You can configure MetricBeat to collect metrics. You can also query the
[stats endpoints](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.6/node-stats-api.html)
directly.
