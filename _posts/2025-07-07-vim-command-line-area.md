In Vim, the bottom line where you type commands like `:w`, `:q`, or `/pattern`
is called Command-line area. I use it everyday, but never know its exact syntax
and how the interpreter works. This post is for this purpose.

## Grammar

The top-level function for Command-line interpreter is function
[do_cmdline](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8fe4e120a2de558fddbb91ba5438d78f3dbd926a/src/nvim/ex_docmd.c#L400).
I copied this whole function to Claude, and Claude told me "The function is
quite sophisticated". Nevertheless, it happily generated an ebnf grammar for
me.

It is fairly complicated! You can write `if`, `for` and `while` control flow
statements in the Command-line area. And can also use `|` to pipe multiple
commands into one.

`do_cmdline` sets up the skeleton of the interpreter. The actual implementation
for each semantic keyword/structure is scattered in different places. For
example, `while`'s implementation is
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8fe4e120a2de558fddbb91ba5438d78f3dbd926a/src/nvim/ex_eval.c#L978).
You can search `void ex_` in file `ex_eval.c`, `ex_cmds.c` and `ex_docmd.c` to
find out what commands Vim has defined and their implementations.

### `:!`

The Bang command is very powerful. The implementation is
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8fe4e120a2de558fddbb91ba5438d78f3dbd926a/src/nvim/ex_docmd.c#L6451).

There are three mainly use cases.

1. `:!<cmd>`: run cmd and show the output in command-line area.
2. `:r!<cmd>`: run cmd and insert the output to the current cursor location.
   This is actually a compound command. `r` means `read` which is another vim
   command, and pattern `r!` has a special
   [code path](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8fe4e120a2de558fddbb91ba5438d78f3dbd926a/src/nvim/ex_docmd.c#L5903).
   Therefore, `:r!date` is shorthand of `:read!date`.
3. `%<range>!<cmd>`: use line range as input to the command, and use the output
   to overwrite this range. This is useful for reformatting code.

### `:normal`

`normal` is another commonly used command. For example, how to insert a
character at the end of each line in a range? One way is
`:<range>normal A<char>`.

The implementation is
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/8fe4e120a2de558fddbb91ba5438d78f3dbd926a/src/nvim/ex_docmd.c#L6920).
Basically, it runs the same command for each line in the range selection.
