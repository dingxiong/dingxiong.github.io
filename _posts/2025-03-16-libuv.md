## Libuv and io_uring

https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/3952

## Projects that use libuv

- Nodejs
- Neovim embeds libuv inside. Checkout this
  [example](https://github.com/rktjmp/fwatch.nvim).
- Python uvloop and many ASGI web server uses uvloop instead of asyncio.

An interesting thing is Redis has its own event loop implementation, and
refused to add libuv support.

## Build libuv

Follow the official documentation
<https://github.com/libuv/libuv#build-instructions>

```
mkdir -p build
cd build && cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cd ..
cmake --build build
```

If you need to build the debug version and see the full compilation commands,
change above line to

```
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG="-g -O0" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG="-g -O0"
```

Remember to do a `make clean` in the build folder first.

### Build an example in the docs folder

We use tcp-echo-server as an example, and suppose we already built libuv in the
above step.

### Dynamic linking

```
gcc docs/code/tcp-echo-server/main.c -I include/ -L ./build -luv -rpath /Users/xiongding/code/libuv/build/
```

It generates a `a.out` file. Inspecting it gives

```
$ otool -L a.out
a.out:
        @rpath/libuv.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1319.100.3)
```

You can add `-g -O0` to the compilation command if you want to debug.

### static linking

```
gcc docs/code/tcp-echo-server/main.c -I include/ build/libuv.a

# verify binary
$ otool -L a.out
a.out:
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1319.100.3)
```

### Run it

In one terminal, run `./a.out`. In another terminal,

```
$ nc localhost 7000
adfas
adfas
dfasdfa
dfasdfa
^C
```

Anything you typed will be echoed back.

### Have fun inside gdb

Macbook M1 does not support gdb, so I can only use lldb. Before we start, make
sure you build both libuv and the example using `-g -O0`.

```
$ lldb a.out
(lldb) b main
Breakpoint 1: where = a.out`main + 40 at main.c:73:12, address = 0x0000000100002c94
(lldb) r
Process 29843 launched: '/Users/xiongding/code/libuv/a.out' (arm64)
Process 29843 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame #0: 0x0000000100002c94 a.out`main at main.c:73:12
   70   }
   71
   72   int main() {
-> 73       loop = uv_default_loop();
   74
   75       uv_tcp_t server;
   76       uv_tcp_init(loop, &server);
Target 0: (a.out) stopped.
(lldb)
```

Having fun with digging around!

## Idle event

I find the idle concept is a little hard to grasp the first time I read it. And
it turns out that it is not only me! See
[issue-1035](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1035). Basically, the
semantics of idle is similar to a 0-timeout repeating timer. Also idle is used
to implement `setImmediate`.

Together with `idle`, there are other two watchers that have the exact same
definition: `prepare` and `check`. We can think of `prepare` as watcher needs
to be processed before IO callbacks, and `check` is watcher processed after IO
callbacks. The macro definition for these three types are
[UV_LOOP_WATCHER_DEFINE](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/e7ecd116e0e013bf8c01d66505ced4ce1b58c005/src/unix/loop-watcher.c#L25).
