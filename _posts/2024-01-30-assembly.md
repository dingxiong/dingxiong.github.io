Each Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has its own assembly language. So there
isn't an universal assembly. For example, given a piece of C code, Gnu as is
capable of assembling it to the target ISA (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC-V).

## Gnu assembler as (sourceware binutils-gdb)

[Gnu binutils project](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) hosts a
collection of binary tools, which include `as`. The source code is mirrored in
[github](https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb). The manual is
[here](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/index.html).

On MacOS, `as` is not Gnu as. Instead it is an alias to `llvm-as`. There are
lots of differences.

First, `.section .text` works in Linux, but not on MacOS. I got a error message
as

```
hello.s:6:15: error: unexpected token in '.section' directive
.section .text
```

The correct way is `.section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions`. Mach-O
architecture is different from ELF. The parser code is
[here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d72bf47606c2a288b911d682fd96129c9c1466d/llvm/lib/MC/MCParser/DarwinAsmParser.cpp#L664).
Basically, it expects `segment_name,section_name,...`. In ELF, we only need to
specify the section name, and the linker knows into which segment to place the
section. But in Mach-O, we need to be explicit. See
[apple developer guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/CodeFootprint/Articles/MachOOverview.html).
On the other hand, there is a universal way to make it work for both ELF and
Mach-O: just use directive `.text`. From the
[code](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d72bf47606c2a288b911d682fd96129c9c1466d/llvm/lib/MC/MCParser/DarwinAsmParser.cpp#L425),
you can see that it is the same as above.

## RISC-V

The best way to try out RISC-V is by riscv-tools. Checkout out git organization
[riscv-software-src](https://github.com/riscv-software-src). It contains RISC-V
installer, compiler and emulator.

Using Macbook M1 as an example,

```bash
brew tap riscv-software-src/riscv
brew install riscv-tools
```

Write a simple C program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Then compile it

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -S hello.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.o -o hello
```

and run it

```
$ spike pk hello
bbl loader
hello world
```

### Registers and instruction set

See

### Registers

I have a hard time of remembering the meaning of registers in amd64
architecture until I found this
[post](http://baileysoriginalirishtech.blogspot.com/2017/02/remember-registers.html).
Just cite the summary below:

> EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX = A, B, C, D; Note that the 'A' register holds function
> return values
>
> ESI, EDI = Source, Destination (for string operations) - ECX may be the
> counter and EAX may used, too.
>
> ESP, EBP = Stack Pointer, Base Pointer
>
> EIP = Instruction Pointer
>
> CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS = Code, Data, Stack, and Extra segments, followed by F
> and G Segments

### Syntax

x86 assembly language has two main syntax branches: Intel syntax and AT&T
syntax. Check
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax) for details
of their differences. Gnu assembler (gas or as) is probably the most popular
one that uses AT&T syntax. And `nasm` is most popular one uses Intel syntax.
