### Registers

I have a hard time of remembering the meaning of registers in amd64
architecture until I found this
[post](http://baileysoriginalirishtech.blogspot.com/2017/02/remember-registers.html).
Just cite the summary below:

> EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX = A, B, C, D; Note that the 'A' register holds function
> return values
>
> ESI, EDI = Source, Destination (for string operations) - ECX may be the
> counter and EAX may used, too.
>
> ESP, EBP = Stack Pointer, Base Pointer
>
> EIP = Instruction Pointer
>
> CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS = Code, Data, Stack, and Extra segments, followed by F
> and G Segments

### Syntax

x86 assembly language has two main syntax branches: Intel syntax and AT&T
syntax. Check
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax) for details
of their differences. Gnu assembler (gas or as) is probably the most popular
one that uses AT&T syntax. And `nasm` is most popular one uses Intel syntax.
